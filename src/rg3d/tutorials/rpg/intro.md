This tutorial starts the series of tutorials about writing a role-playing game in Rust using rg3d game engine. Strangely,
but rg3d has a reputation of an engine for 3D shooters. In this series I'll try to prove that it is a general purpose
game engine.

## rg3d and rusty-editor version

rg3d changes rapidly and tutorial's code could not compile with the newest versions of the engine, to prevent that
and keep the code compilable over time the versions of both the engine and the editor are set to specific commits 
in the main repo.

**rg3d version**: specific commit ([5564b6e](https://github.com/rg3dengine/rg3d/commit/a3c3d678c361aa72fc44c36f3e37adc20a54f311))  
**rusty-editor version**: specific commit ([ca0da2e](https://github.com/rg3dengine/rusty-editor/commit/81c942d7bd3e70d3604db803ca987af933d44773))
