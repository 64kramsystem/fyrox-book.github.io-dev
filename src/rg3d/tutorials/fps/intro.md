# First-Person Shooter Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll make a 3D shooter - something similar to [rusty-shooter](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-shooter).
Also, the series should help you to learn basic principles which lies in the foundation of the engine.

## rg3d and rusty-editor version

rg3d changes rapidly and tutorial's code could not compile with the newest versions of the engine, to prevent that
and keep the code compilable over time the versions of both the engine and the editor are set to specific commits 
in the main repo.

**rg3d version**: specific commit ([5564b6e](https://github.com/rg3dengine/rg3d/commit/d511b92aa6aa132794e25d0f3c0cc110272f9f56))
